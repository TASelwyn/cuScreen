Hello Thomas,

We have become aware of a Reddit posting made by you that shows a video where you instruct others on how to automate the completion of the Screening Self-Assessment in CUScreen.

We ask that you remove this today and cease to communicate with others on how automate this process. Please let me know by email once this has been completed.


Thanks

Andrew
